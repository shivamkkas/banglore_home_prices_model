Bangalore Home Prices Prediction Model
This project aims to create a machine learning model to predict home prices in Bangalore, India. The model is built using Python and various libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, etc., and their corresponding home prices. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

Model
The model is trained using a Linear Regression algorithm to predict home prices based on the input features. It achieves an accuracy of 86% on the test dataset.

Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the prediction script:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
Input the required features when prompted.

Future Work
In future iterations, we plan to improve the model's accuracy by exploring different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
